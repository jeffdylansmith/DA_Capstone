## Overview
This project will examine the effects of weather on traffic accidents in Davidson County.  I wanted to study this to examine if there are any relationships between frequency / severity / locations that exist which could be used to benefit public safety.  

## Motivation
I wanted to examine the relationship between weather and traffic accidents to see if there are any useful measurable facts that emerge such as # of accidents per inch of rainfall/snow.  

## Data Question
Are there any aspects of the relationship between weather and traffic accident frequency / severity that could be used as predictive indicators?  Do these relationships hold up during the time of covid?  

## Data Sources
I purchased a csv data set of [Nashville weather](https://https://openweathermap.org) since 1990 and [Davidson County accidents](https://data.nashville.gov/Police/Traffic-Accidents/6v6w-hpcw) are available on the Metro public data site.
